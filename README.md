## Outline
PSF Generator is a Java software package that allows one to generate and visualize various 3D models of a microscope PSF. The current version has more than fifteen different models:
* 3D diffractive models: scalar-based diffraction model Born & Wolf, scalar-based diffraction model with 3 layers Gibson & Lanni, and vectorial-based model Richards & Wolf, and Variable Refractive Index Gibson & Lanni model.
* Defocussing a 2D lateral function with 1D axial function: the available lateral functions are: "Gaussian", "Lorentz", "Cardinale-Sine", "Cosine", "Circular-Pupil", "Astigmatism", "Oriented-Gaussian", "Double-Helix".
* Optical Transfer Function generated in the Fourier domain: Koehler simulation, defocus simulation.

PSF Generator is provided for several environments: as ImageJ/Fiji plugin, as an Icy plugin, and as a Java standalone application. The program requires only few parameters which are readily-available for microscopy practitioners. Our Java implementation achieves fast execution times, as it is based on multi-threading the computational tasks and on a numerical method that adapts to the oscillatory nature of the required integrands. Potential applications are 3D deconvolution, 3D particle localization and tracking, and extended depth of field estimation to name a few.
